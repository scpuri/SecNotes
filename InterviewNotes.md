1. Customer Obsession: Leaders start with the customer and work backwards, focusing on delivering value and a great experience.

2. Ownership: Leaders act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They think long-term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results.

3. Invent and Simplify: Leaders seek out new solutions and ways to simplify processes. They encourage innovation and creative problem-solving.

4. Are Right, A Lot: Leaders have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

11. Earn Trust: Leaders build trust through integrity and transparency. They communicate openly and are sincere in their interactions.

12. Dive Deep: Leaders operate at all levels and stay connected to the details. No task is beneath them.

15. Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer: Leaders work to create a safer, more inclusive, and more innovative work environment.
